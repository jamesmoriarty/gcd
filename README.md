# GCD

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.[1][2]

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

```ruby
